## map.js

This is a sample taken from a site I built with Jekyll and Liquid.

It demonstrates a dynamic map that automatically plots markers and tooltip info for vendors as they are added by the client
through the CMS.

The client has locations in multiple parts of the state so I added buttons to navigate through them.
