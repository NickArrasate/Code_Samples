# Code_Samples

## map.js from NeverwinterNW.com

This is a sample taken from a site I built with Jekyll and Liquid.

It demonstrates a dynamic map that automatically plots markers and tooltip info for vendors as they are added by the client
through the CMS.

The client has locations in multiple parts of the state so I added buttons to navigate through them.

The map can be viewed at https://neverwinternw.com/, a site I built myself.


##Guavagrams (interface and logic)

These to .js files contain the logic for a game built while at Epicodus. The game was built by myself and two others in a four day sprint. It is not currently hosted but it can easily be run locally
by downloading it and following the README at https://github.com/NickArrasate/Demo_Day_Guava.
